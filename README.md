## Hello

A motivated self-starter with a passion for technology and an eye for design. Having taught myself to code and build websites I decided to pursue my passion and become a full stack developer. I'm an enthusiastic learner and always looking to improve and add new skills. A natural team leader with a history of delivering successful projects, I am passionate about building elegant solutions to real problems.

Having spend over ten years in retail operations and fulfilment I have a wealth of experience in project management and project delivery. I was fortunate to be a part of the launch team for [Enjoy Technology](https://www.enjoy.com/en-uk/) in the UK. Working in a fast-paced startup environment, I gained great stakeholder management and communication skills while defining and evolving standard operating procedures.

Software development is the perfect combination of my technology and creative passion, having previously studied both Audio Engineering and Music performance. Being able to produce creative products from a technical codebase is extremely exciting and you are limited only by your imagination.

## Skills

### Problem Solver

Able to get to the root cause of an issue and work through solutions to reach resolution.

* Being selected to be part of the opening team at Enjoy UK we were faced with many challenges opening up a whole new market and country operation. 
* I helped achieve a successful launch by breaking these challenges down into small components and iterating through solutions. Taking standard operating procedures and refining them allowed us to open lean while still achieving our targets. 
* Enjoy UK now operates in 10 U.K cities and continuously growing.

### Motivated self-starter

Not afraid to take on a new challenge and self-motivated to learn new skills when needed. Able to accurately self-reflect and identify areas for improvement.

* Whilst working full time and travelling with work I was able to teach myself how to build websites and coding languages in my spare time.
* Evidence of this is one of my first website builds, [ShortCut Club](https://shortcutclub.co.uk/). This project included migrating the hosting package that was also tied to their business email.
