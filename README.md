## Hello

A motivated self-starter with a passion for technology and an eye for design. Having taught myself to code and build websites I decided to pursue my passion and become a full stack developer. I'm an enthusiastic learner and always looking to improve and add new skills. A natural team leader with a history of delivering successful projects, I am passionate about building elegant solutions to real problems.

Having spend over ten years in retail operations and fulfilment I have a wealth of experience in project management and project delivery. I was fortunate to be a part of the launch team for [Enjoy Technology](https://www.enjoy.com/en-uk/) in the UK. Working in a fast-paced startup environment, I gained great stakeholder management and communication skills while defining and evolving standard operating procedures.

Software development is the perfect combination of my technology and creative passion, having previously studied both Audio Engineering and Music performance. Being able to produce creative products from a technical codebase is extremely exciting and you are limited only by your imagination.
